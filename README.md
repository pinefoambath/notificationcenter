# README

This Rails app models a notification center REST API. Admin users can create notifications, allocate them to users, and see whether these users have seen the notification. Users can see the notifications allocated to them.

## Accessing the API endpoints

This is the first API I've built from scratch. I haven't had time to research and set up token-based authentication (or, I have spent some time researching Tiddle as a token-based authentication service that runs with Devise but then I ran out of timeðŸ™ƒ). Instead, I have gone with Devise for restricting users to their only their notifications, and for restricting all other API endpoints to admin users. For this app to run smoothly I'm guessing token-based authentication is needed in the future. 

### Seeing your own notifications as a user

-> send a POST request to: localhost:3000/api/v1/users/:id, specifying the id of the user. 

### Creating a new notification (admins only)

-> send a POST request to: localhost:3000/api/v1/notifications, the parameters can be "title", "description" and a date

### Allocating a notification to one or more users (admins only)

--> send a POST request to localhost:3000/api/v1/assignments. Parameters need to be "user_id" and "notification_id". 

### Checking if a user has read their notifications
The moment a user has made a successful call to their "view notifications" endpoint, we assume that they have read all the notifications allocated to them. For an admin to check if that has been the case, they can send a GET request to localhost:3000/api/v1/check_read, sending the "user_id" and "notification_id" as a parameter.


## Launching the app as a developer


The app requires Ruby version 3.1.1

To install all dependencies type

```bash
bundle install 
```

You will need to create, migrate and seed a database:

```bash
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

Tests: This repo currently does not run the tests when you type rails test (it's a bug and I didn't get around fixing it). You can run the tests inline though (depending on the IDE you are using). 

To run the app you need to start both a rails server and Sidekiq. To start the server type: 

```bash
rails s
```

You will also need to install and start Sidekiq. Sidekiq will help us push new notifications to the Mock Push Service ansynchronous. 

To install sidekiq:

```bash
bundle binstub sidekiq
```

and then in a new tap run:

```bash
sidekiq
```
